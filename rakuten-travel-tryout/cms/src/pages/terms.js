          PAGE OR PART OF THE WEBSITE OR ACCESS OR USE AN API (AS THE CASE MAY BE). If you access or use the Website or
          an API, or link to the Website, on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have authority to
          unconditionally accept the Terms on behalf of that entity and to bind that entity to the Terms (and the

          professional advice as you consider necessary. The HKMA shall not be liable for any errors, omissions,
          misstatements or misrepresentations (express or implied) concerning any Information or any aspect of the
          Website or an API. The HKMA shall not have or accept any liability, obligation or responsibility whatsoever
          for any Loss howsoever arising from or in respect of any use or misuse of or reliance on the Website, the
          Information and/or APIs, any interruption or inability to access or use the Website, the Information and/or
          APIs, or any transmission from you to the HKMA or vice versa over the Internet, whether in contract, tort,
          breach of statutory duty or otherwise. Access to and use of the Website, the APIs and the Information are
          entirely at your own risk. The HKMA reserves the right, but does not undertake, to revise, modify or update
          the Website and/or the Information and/or release updated versions of an API from time to time, which may be
          done without any notice. The HKMA also reserves the right to revise, omit, edit, suspend or terminate the
          provision of the Information to any person, or to block access from a particular Internet Protocol (IP)
          address to the Website or the APIs, at any time in its absolute discretion without giving any reason or prior
          notice whatsoever. The HKMA may discontinue the provision of any Information or API without any notice. Use of
          Information / Linking to the Website Save as otherwise specifically allowed by the Terms, you may only, for
          non-commercial purposes, display, download, reproduce, and print in its original format the Information on the

          Information and linking to the Website shall be subject to the Terms and your compliance with all applicable
          laws and regulations; the Information must be reproduced accurately without any modification; you shall give
          proper attribution to the HKMA and the Website by identifying clearly the source of the Information, and
          acknowledge the HKMA’s ownership of the intellectual property rights in the Information and in all its copies
          (in whatever form or medium); you shall indemnify the HKMA against all allegations or claims of infringement
          of the rights of any person and all Loss incurred by the HKMA, which in any case arise directly or indirectly
          in relation to your use, reproduction and/or distribution of the Information and/or linking to the Website;
          and at the request of the HKMA, you shall forthwith destroy any copy of the Information (in whatever form or
          medium) in your possession or control and/or remove any link to the Website. The HKMA’s prior written consent
          is required for linking to the Website or the use of the Information owned by the HKMA for any purpose or in
          any way which is not permitted under paragraph 12 above. Any enquiry or request for consent should be
          addressed to the HKMA via email at webmaster@hkma.gov.hk. The permission given under paragraph 12 above does
          not extend to any material on linked websites or any content on the Website the copyright of which belongs to
          a third party. Authorisation or permission to use such materials and/or contents would need to be obtained
          from the copyright holders concerned. You shall not use the HKMA’s name, trademarks or logos in a way from
          which a connection or affiliation with the HKMA can reasonably be inferred or implied, or use the Information
          or link to the Website in a manner that gives any impression that you or the host website is sponsored or
          endorsed by the HKMA, without the prior written consent from the HKMA. Linked Information and other
          Third-Party Websites The Website contains links to third party websites, which are provided for convenience
          only. The HKMA does not sponsor or endorse such third parties or their websites, and the HKMA and the Website
          shall not be deemed to be part of, or associated or affiliated in whatever manner with, any such third parties
          or their websites (or any aspect thereof). The HKMA is not responsible for, and does not give any
          representation or warranty of any kind (whether express or implied) with respect to, such third parties or
          their websites, or the contents or any other aspect of such third party websites. The HKMA shall not be liable
          for any Loss howsoever arising from or in respect of any access to, use or misuse of or reliance on those
          websites, or any interruption or inability to access or use those websites. Use of the links and access to and
          use of the linked websites are entirely at your own risk, and you are responsible for complying with any terms
          and conditions of use of such websites. Additional terms on use of APIs Certain Information may be accessed
          through an API, and all such Information made available through the API is subject to the Terms. You may use
          the APIs to develop, whether for commercial or non-commercial purposes, a software, application, website,
          system or service to search, display, analyse, retrieve, view and otherwise obtain such Information, on the
          same conditions as set out in subparagraphs 12(a) to 12(e) above and the following conditions: such use of the
          APIs shall be subject to the Terms and your compliance with all applicable laws and regulations; you shall
          require end-users of your software, applications, websites, systems or services to comply with (and not
          knowingly enable them to violate) the Terms and applicable law and regulations; at the request of the HKMA,
          you shall forthwith stop any use of the APIs. You agree that the HKMA may monitor use of the APIs for various
          purposes, including but not limited to service improvement, verification of compliance with the Terms, and
          security-related purposes. You will not interfere with this monitoring. Without prejudice to paragraph 12
          above, you shall indemnify the HKMA against all Loss in relation to any claim made by a third party against
          the HKMA arising directly or indirectly from a third party’s use of any of your software, applications,
          websites, systems or services that use the APIs. The HKMA does not accept liability, obligation or
          responsibility for any Information once it has been released via APIs. Governing Law and Jurisdiction The
          Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
          of the People’s Republic of China (“Hong Kong”) and you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
          Hong Kong courts. Rights of Third Parties You agree that nothing in the Terms confers or purports to confer on
          any third party any benefit or any right to enforce any of the Terms pursuant to the Contracts (Rights of
          Third Parties) Ordinance (Chapter 623 of the Laws of Hong Kong). Miscellaneous The Terms may be amended from
          time to time by the HKMA without any notice. Accessing or using or linking to the Website or using an API or
          its contents after any such amendments constitutes acceptance of such amendments. Please check the Terms
          regularly for any amendments which may be made. The English version of the Terms shall prevail in the event of
          a conflict with other language versions. All rights are reserved by the HKMA, including the right to terminate
          the Terms with you.
